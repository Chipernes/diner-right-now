# Diner Right Now - Service project

## Local development setup
**1.** Install dependencies: `npm install`

## Development Server

**1.** Start the development server: `npm run start:dev`

**2.** Open the application in your browser at: http://localhost:3000/graphql

## Mongo DB

If you still don't have mongo db working in local, please follow next steps.

Open `mongod` in your local device

Your MongoDB should be available under following host:

By default, drn-service is connecting with MongoDB on `localhost:27017` and creating new database called `diner-right-now`.
